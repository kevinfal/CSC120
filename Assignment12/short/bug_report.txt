I have found within Russ' program. The bug is
in line 37 in   

        for line in input_file:
            line = line.strip()
            if line[0] == '#' or len(line) == 0:
                continue

if the line is '\n', it is stripped so it is ''
the if statement tries to access the [0]th element
before it checks the lengths, so it throws an error

The proper procedure would be to check if the length is 0
else check if the first character is '#'
